# SET:
# A Python set is the collection of the unordered items.
# Each element in the set must be unique, immutable, and the sets remove the duplicate elements.
# Sets are mutable which means we can modify it after its creation.



a = {}
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# {}
# <class 'dict'>

b = {1,2,3,4,5}
# print(b)
# print(type(b))
# {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# <class 'set'>


c= {1,2,3,4,5, True,2,4,23,14}
print(c)
# {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 23, 14}
