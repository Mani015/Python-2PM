# User-defined function

# Functions which are created by programmer explicitly according to the requirement are called a user-defined function.

# Creating a Function
# Sy:
# def functionName():
#     block of code

# functioncalling()


# Use the following steps to to define a function in Python.
#
# Use the def keyword with the function name to define a function.
# Next, pass the number of parameters as per your requirement. (Optional).
# Next, define the function body with a block of code.
# This block of code is nothing but the action you wanted to perform.
# In Python, no need to specify curly braces for the function body.
# The only indentation is essential to separate code blocks. Otherwise, you will get an error.
