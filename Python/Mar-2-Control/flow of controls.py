# A program’s control flow is the order in which the program’s code executes.
#
# The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.
#
# Python has three types of control structures:
#
# Sequential - default mode
# Selection - used for decisions and branching
# Repetition - used for looping, i.e., repeating a piece of code multiple times.


# 1. Sequential
# Sequential statements are a set of statements whose execution process happens in a sequence.
# The problem with sequential statements is that if the logic has broken in any one of the lines,
# then the complete source code execution will break.
