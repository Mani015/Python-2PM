# In Python, the selection statements are also known as Decision control statements or branching statements.

# The selection statement allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true.


# if,
# else,
# elif,
# nested - if

# Syntax:
#  if condtion :
#        block of code

# print('hi')
# a=10
# n= int(input('enter one number:'))
# if a==n:
#     print(True)

# n = eval(input('Enter one number:'))
# if n % 2 == 0:
#    print("n is an even number")


if 10>5:
    print('10 is greater than 5')
